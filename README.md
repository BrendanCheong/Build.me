# Build.me-Orbital-2021


## What is this project about?

This is a web scraping web application build by Zhi Xuan and Brendan Cheong for Orbital 2021. The Objective of this web application is to be able to collate different PC part prices from local e-commerce websites like Qoo10, Shoppee and Amazon.sg to make part hunting easier for the user while letting the user find the best deals online

## Motivation

When trying to find PC parts to build a computer, it’s difficult to collate different PC parts prices from different vendors from online shops like Lazada and Shopee since there are so many brands and types of PC parts and therefore, no efficient way to find the best prices from the highest rated vendors from these e-commerce platforms, as scanning through all these platforms becomes time-consuming.

Ultimately, many have become frustrated that finding the best parts for their PC build has become inconvenient and stressful especially since most PC-builders have a tight budget that they need to keep track of. Moreover, most PC-builders have different combinations of PC parts and have difficulties comparing between builds to find the best combination.
If only there was a web application that could collate all this information and make the PC building process easier.

## Aim

Through our web application “Build.me”, we hope to be able to simplify and streamline the price hunting process of finding PC-parts while also providing the user with analytical tools and data visualisation tools about their PC builds.

## Tech Stack used

For this project, we used the MERN stack (MongoDB,Express,React and Node) together with complimentary frameworks and libraries like Tailwindcss and Puppeteer.js
